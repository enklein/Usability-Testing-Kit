# Debriefing
*Read through this guide and add a new page for your notes. You should definitely be taking notes.*

## Key Takeaways
The two takeaways from a a successful debriefing session are:
* A list of the most serious usability problems that participants encountered while using the product or feature
* A list of problems you're going to fix with priorities for backlog grooming

This should take place as soon as possible after the testing sessions so that it is all fresh, and only include people that have attended at least one of the morning's test sessions. Also, make it a lunch if possible.

Also these can be a single list, as long as its actionable.

## Bad News First
All products have issues, everyone is busy, resources are limited — be intensely focused on fixing only the most serious problems first.

In determining severity, consider:
* Will a lot of people experience this problem?
* Will it cause a serious problem for the people who experience it, or is it just an inconvenience?

## Running the Debriefing
The person running the tests needs to run the debriefing and it goes a little like this:
1. Begin by explaining how it's going to work: "From your lists of usability problems that you observed during the sessions, we're going to choose the # most serious ones. Then we are going to prioritize them and agree on which ones we're going to commit to fixing as soon as possible." (← something like that)
2. Ask everyone to review the list of problems they wrote down during the test sessions and choose the three that they think are the most serious
3. Go around the room and ask people to read theirs aloud. If it already came up, make sure they mention that it did.
4. Write all of these down and note duplicates
5. Pull the top ten (vote of necessary but UX and PO should lead this)
6. Re-order the list by severity
7. Work down the list without skipping any, have the team discuss potential solutions and ways each can be fixed asap (minimum viable product but not a bandaid that leaves users with a bad experience)
8. Continue down the list for as long as resources can commit to fixing these issues, then stop

## Tips for a Successful Debriefing
* Have some guidelines up for participants to see:
    * Stick to what you've observed
    * Focus on the most serious problems
    * Objective: a list of problems we'll fix asap
* Take confidence in what you're doing. Hopefully you're the one in the room with the most knowledge about usability.
* Have a laptop available with the recordings of the sessions in case you have to check anything.
* You don't have a lot of time, so keep people on track. Don't let it get into debates and focus on what was observed.
* Run a clean meeting, acknowledge every contribution, and don't belittle anything (accidentally or purposefully).
* Don't skip anything on your prioritized list. The whole point of finding usability problems is fixing them.
* Be wary of things like, "It's a problem now, but it should be fixed when we roll out xyz project" or "let's just backlog this"
* If something gets backlogged, make sure it's prioritized and get an idea of when it should be tackled. If it's important enough to be documented, it's important enough to plan for.

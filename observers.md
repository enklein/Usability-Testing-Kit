# Observers
Have observers; they're critical to the success of a usability testing session. These are the people helping take notes and come up with additional questions.

## Observers / Participants
* If scope allows for only one, they can be in-room.
* If you have multiple observers, choose a leader and set them all up in another room with the receiving end of screen-share software.
* You can have different observers covering different sessions, but it helps the debriefing session to have multiple observers covering multiple sessions.
* All observers are expected to attend the debriefing session.

## Observer Duties
The only observers allowed to work on tasks outside of usability testing are stakeholders, but they're highly encouraged to stay involved.

Observer duties include:
* Watching, learning, and taking notes.
* Writing down the three most important usability problems they saw in each session.
* Suggesting questions they'd like to have the facilitator ask the participant.
* (Optionally enjoying snacks).
* Attending the debriefing session.

Observers should get copies of:
* Their instructions, either for In-Person or Remote testing.
* The test script.
* The scenarios for the tasks that the participants will be doing.

### Observer + Instructions + Room
Be sure to provide the observers with instructions and ways to take notes.
* Set them up in a conference room or as muted participants in a web-call and make sure they can hear the test and see the material
* Make sure that people watching are also helping with notes and making it a meaningful experience for the other observers, not just watching from their desks if at all possible.

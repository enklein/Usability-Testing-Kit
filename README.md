# Usability Testing Kit
A cloneable usability testing kit mostly following Steve Krug's process detailed in *Rocket Surgery Made Easy*.

## Purpose: Why conduct usability testing?
We discover usability issues with tasks or features and turn them into actionable tasks through Usability Testing.

Participants are walked through different scenarios relating to a task or feature and think out loud before a guide and a separated observer. Each participant's results are discussed over a debriefing session and a prioritized list of usability issues is created.

### Early Considerations
**Problem + Solution.** For most of your usability testing, try to target a specific user objective. Once you've identified any problems the user has reaching the objective, be sure to also note solution opportunities.
**Security.** Ensure the parties you test with have the necessary clearance to view the project, and that any security assessments and inquiries are handled in advance.
**Consent.** If any screen-, audio-, or video-recording is used, ensure the user's consent to be recorded is documented.

# Conducting Usability Tests
Review this walkthrough before conducting usability tests. Ensure you have all handouts and your script ready before testing. The script has tasks written in to help guide you.

## Before Each Test
Ready your screen recording and sharing software and ready the material for the participant.

* Start screen sharing, if necessary
* Reload sample date, if necessary, and prepare the test material to the 'start' step
* Start the screen recorder

## Testing, Script Reading
Read the script you've prepared to the letter to ensure you cover everything and say it in a way to help reduce the risk of the participant from getting the wrong impression about anything. The script reading includes the Consent to Record form
* Work from your template, making sure to revise it beforehand so that it is specific to this session
* Have them sign the consent to record form

### Initial Interview Questions
These questions are important to get the participants comfortable with thinking aloud, to show them that you're listening, and to get a basic understanding of how tech-savy they might be.
* Adapt the questions as needed for your product and users.

### Home/Start Screen Tour
Read the brief script and let them look over the starting/home screen (excluding any initial login).
* This is to get the more comfortable with thinking out loud while interacting with the product and to gauge how approachable it is.
* The participant is not allowed to interact with the screen, only scroll.
* This will also help to see if the nature of the product is clear. Can users figure out what this thing is?
* This allows you to also gauge how much domain knowledge the user might have as well — how much they might already know about the product and what it's for.
* If your project/product does not have one, consider adding one and what it might to do enhance the task-oriented experience your project offers.

### Tasks
Give the participant each scenario one by one and then read it aloud word for word.
* Reading it aloud ensures that they don't start ahead without reading the entire thing.
* Make a note if you have any follow up questions, save them for the follow up segment
* Try not to interrupt any more than necessary — keep them focused and thinking aloud.
* Move on as they are ready: If they have completed the task, if they seem miserable, if the time is ticking too long, and if it seems there's nothing else to learn from them and this screen/scenario.

### Follow-Up Questions
Document anything specific you might want to ask them about to go over after the tasks are complete if you have enough time.
* Call or call in the observer or person leading the observers to go over any questions they might have.
* This is for questions like, "Did you notice..." and "Why did you choose ..."
* Ask follow up questions to see if there's anything else they might find useful or that would help them complete the task better.

## Wrapping Up
* Thank the participant
* Ask if they have any questions (follow the Fellow security policy when answering)
* Give them the incentive if applicable or remind them it will be sent to them

### Preparing for the Next Test
If you reserved an hour for the test, use no more than 50 minutes to give yourself time to prepare for the next test.
* Make any notes you need to make
* Reset any of the testing materials as needed
* Consider any adjustments: If the participant(s) in previous session(s) couldn't complete a task for obvious reasons, you can modify or skip the task for the remaining participants.

## Pro-Tips for a Successful Usability Test
* You're trying to get them to externalize their thought process
* You're trying not to influence them
* You say the same few things over and over (much like a therapist)
* You have ethical responsibilities
* Keep them talking. If they pause for too long, ask what they're thinking. If you don't know what they're thinking when they make a certain face, ask
* Read all of your scenarios and scripts out loud before putting them in use to catch any errors
* Get stakeholders and developers and designers and QA and whoever-else-needs-to-see-to-believe involved and observing
* Advertise, make it easy to attend, make it clear what's in it for them, and maybe provide snacks for those observing in person
* Check out [Steve Krug's "Things a Therapist Would Say"](http://sensible.com/downloads/things-a-therapist-would-say.pdf) for help interacting with participants.

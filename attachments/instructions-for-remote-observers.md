Thanks for coming to today’s tests.

`Each of the three sessions will last about 50 minutes, with a ten-minute break in between.`

To get as much as we can out of these tests, we need your help with a few things:

* **Take notes**. Please make notes about anything interesting you notice, particularly points where the user was confused or couldn’t get the tasks done. We’ll be comparing notes during the debriefing session.
    * **Task oriented**. Try to note the time per task and any task-specific points of interest.
* **Make a list at the end of each session.** After the testing session (or during the break between sessions), jot down the three most serious usability problems you noticed in that session.
`* **Come to the debriefing.** If at all possible, we’d love to have you join us for the debriefing where we’ll compare notes and decide what usability problems are most critical.`
* **If you think of a question you’d like to ask the participant, write it down.** Near the end of each session, we’ll check to see if you have any questions.
* **Stay as long as you can.** We know you have other commitments`, but there are only a few sessions, and each one will offer different lessons`. Even if you start to lose interest, try to keep watching and listening—you never know when the participant will say something revealing. You can come and go if you need to, but please try to do it unobtrusively.
* **Stay Muted During the Testing.** Please stay muted during the testing session(s) so the participant and facilitator can focus and operate the test as smoothly as possible. Near the end of the session, the facilitator will check in to see if you have any questions for the participant.

Thanks for your help!

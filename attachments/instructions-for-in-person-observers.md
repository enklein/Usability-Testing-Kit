Thanks for coming to today’s tests.

`Each of the three sessions will last about 50 minutes, with a ten-minute break in between.`

To get as much as we can out of these tests, we need your help with a few things:

* **Take notes**. Please make notes about anything interesting you notice, particularly points where the user was confused or couldn’t get the tasks done. We’ll be comparing notes during the debriefing session at lunchtime today.
    * **Task oriented**. Try to note the time per task and any task-specific points of interest.
* **Make a list at the end of each session.** During the break between sessions, jot down the three most serious usability problems you noticed in that session.
`* **Come to the debriefing.** If at all possible, we’d love to have you join us at ___ pm in room _____________, where we’ll compare notes and decide what usability problems we’re going to fix in the next month.`
* **If you think of a question you’d like to ask the participant, write it down.** Near the end of each session, we’ll check to see if you have any questions.
* **Stay as long as you can.** We know you have other commitments, but there are only a few sessions, and each one will offer different lessons. Even if you start to lose interest, try to keep watching and listening—you never know when the participant will say something revealing. You can come and go if you need to, but please try to do it unobtrusively.
* **Try to avoid distracting others.** Following a test can require concentration. Try to limit your conversation to what you’re observing. If you need to have another kind of discussion or answer a phone call, please step outside the room. Think of it as a movie theater: don’t talk loud enough or long enough that the people around you can’t follow the plot.

Thanks for your help!

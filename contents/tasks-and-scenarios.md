# Tasks & Scenarios
Tasks are derived from features and become scenarios used in your usability testing sessions.

## Steps
1. Draft a list of tasks for the product or feature â€” maybe the 5 or 10 most important things people need to be able to do when using the product or feature.
2. Narrow these down to find which most crucial tasks should be tested.
3. Make the tasks into scenarios: Convert the simple description of the task into a script the user can read, understand, and follow.
    a. Avoid leading them too much or giving them hints.
4. Pilot test the scenarios to make sure they are clear, complete, and unambiguous.
5. Provide these to the stakeholder for approval and inputs.
6. Print the tasks + scenarios for you and observers and print the scenarios for the participant:
    a. Use index carts or half-sheets of paper per scenario so they can reference it during the session and so they can focus on one at a time.
    b. Have a list of them all on one page for you and for any observers.

## Example Task + Scenario
**Task:** Save your compliance report.

**Scenario:** You've got an upcoming appointment with your doctor and you've decided to save your compliance report to print later to share with them. Save or share the report.

# Planning Your Usability Testing (Checklist)
Review these steps well in advance of any usability testing for best results.

[Go Up a Page](../README.md)

## Advanced Prep
* [ ] Figure out what will be tested, either the app's main features for a broader test or new features or improvements after a sprint
* [ ] Create list of [Tasks & Scenarios](tasks-and-scenarios.md)
* [ ] Update the [Script Template](../attachments/script.md) as needed including pre-test interview questions
* [ ] Schedule a test day with blocks for at least three participants and a lunch that follows for a debriefing session with observers and stakeholders
    * [ ] Reach out to potential observers and communicate their role in testing
    * [ ] Ensure stakeholders can make the debriefing if at all possible â€” it is needed to prioritize the usability issues so they become actionable tasks
* [ ] Figure out who to test with
    * [ ] Make any arrangements with Security as needed
    * [ ] Contact potential participants
    * [ ] Schedule meeting times on the same day with each, book a room if possible
* [ ] Get feedback on your list of tasks from team and stakeholders
* [ ] Arrange incentives for participants (especially if they are not employees)

## Prep
* [ ] Install and test screen recording and screen sharing software and equipment for testing
* [ ] Contact your participants, reminding them about the session, answering any questions about the session, and ensuring their attendance
* [ ] Revise any scenarios as needed based on stakeholder feedback
* [ ] Get any usernames/passwords and sample data needed for the test
* [ ] Make copies of handouts for participants ([Recording Consent Form](../attachments/consent-form.md), [Scenarios](tasks-and-scenarios.md), NDA if needed)
* [ ] Make copies of handouts for any observers (Instructions for Observers [In-Person](../attachments/instructions-for-in-person-observers.md) or [Remote](../attachments/instructions-for-remote-observers.md), [Scenarios](tasks-and-scenarios.md), copy of your [Script](../attachments/script.md))
* [ ] Make sure incentives are ready if provided

## Test Day
**Morning, Prior to Testing**
* [ ] Test that test materials and software are working and ready (and screen sharing works if there are observers)
* [ ] Turn off or disable anything on the test computer/device that might interrupt the test (do not disturb node, email, calendar reminders, etc.)
* [ ] If there are multiple observers (3+) ensure the one asked to lead is ready and prepared, provide all handouts

**Before, During, and After Testing**
* [ ] Follow the guide to [Conducting the Usability Tests](conducting-usability-tests.md) and walk through your [Script](../attachments/script.md).

## Debriefing
* [ ] Follow the guide to [Debriefing](debriefing.md) on the Testing Day lunch, take notes, and come up with an actionable list of usability problems that need solving.

## Documentation
* [ ] Fill out the [Documentation](documentation.md) page.

## After Testing
* [ ] Send Thank You notes to any external participants along with any approved marketing materials
